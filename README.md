# You can see the website here:

# ---> http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

# The site I have made cannot translate because I could not get the API key of the website whose API I want to use for free, so the project could not be fully completed.

# how it works?
- You can get a new sentence by clicking any key on your keyboard. 
- After clicking any key on keyboard the web sends a warning message to get another sentence. 
- You can see the new sentence after you click "okay" button to the incoming message.
